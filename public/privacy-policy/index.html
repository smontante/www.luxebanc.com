            <p>Nvestor Funding does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide
                targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third
                party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to
                tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your web browser may allow you to set
                the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to
                be tracked.
